Project notes

Upper saxon
* transducer from standard german to upper saxon (Khan et al 2013)

* upper saxon lacks voicing contrast in obstruents

b -> p
d -> t

* Fricatives /f s ʃ X/  and obstruents /p t k/ are only (sometimes) voiced between sonorants (p. 232 ff)
* never voiced word- initially or finally

Clusters
* In initial clusters with /l/, stops /t k/ do not contrast and can vary freely (p 234)
/kl/ -> /tl/
* final -ig/-ich/-isch in standard german becomes a /ʃ/-cluster (p 234)

syllabic consonants
* final nasals and laterals are syllabic following a stop or fricative): /ˈɔˁːpae̯tn̩/ arbeiten (p 235)
* syllabic nasals share the place of the preceeding consonant /ˈhɛlfm̩/ helfen
* when the vowel before the two final consonants is long, the first consonsnt is deleted:  /ˈpɛːpm̩/ beben ‘to shake’ pronounced [pɛːm]
